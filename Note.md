# Note

I thought I should need some notes to let you know my current status and situation.

It's insanely busy for the last week after I sent you questionnaire. At that time, I didn't know what will comes to me.

My wife told me she had been thinking to move back to Korea because Japan becomes worse for handling this virus issue.

Even I got to know that young children should stay in the hospital if they got the virus and no one cannot go to the hospital even thought parents.

In this situation, my wife and I didn't sleep well in order to think how to do it. Unfortunately, I don't have much time to focus on this coding test.

Anyway, every night my wife adn I discuss it and decide to move back to Korean on Thursday morning suddenly. My family took off at the afternoon on the same day.

BTW, after we landed on Korea, my wife become a candidate to be examined because she had a symptom. She came back on Friday afternoon and my Thrusday and Friday has brown so far.

Saturday, my wife and I clean up my Korean home all days because we came back for three months and will live at least two months.

As a result, my code didn't get good enough. My code works well, but I know the purpose of this coding test is not just writing a code which works well.
 
I've tried to write some tests and do my effort that my code could be tested well. I can explain all of my implementation, limitations and improvement points if you give me a chance to do it.

I know the whole things looks like a clumsy excuse. I thought that I couldn't pass your interviews but I didn't want you to get me wrong and judge me as a lazy and rude engineer.

Hope this help you understand me more.

Thank you.
